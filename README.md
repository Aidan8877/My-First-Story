# My-First-Story
This tory begins with a being from a non friendly planet, a planet which has gone off the deep end and on a course of destruction in the many years to come. He has come from a world where smog and dark clouds fill the sky, and megastructures soaring the skylines and touching orbit. In the distance, heavy industrial contraptions echo throughout the buildings, and machinery humming with operation. Creating an atmosphere of being a spec inside a dark ashtray. All of these structures of overarching proportions appeared to have sharp edges at the very top of their maximum hirght vcan go, in fact, it was a if a giant had shattered a black glass bottle on the ground, and stuck the pieces inside and allover it. however, there was one structure which ruled them all, it was a sort of building with an apperance almost similar to the great pyramid.
